# Mouse-Cheese

There are no data structures or algorithms in this project that are not authored by me.

This is a game in which mouse is hunting cheese. When mouse step on the filed which is taken by cheese it means that
cheese was eaten by mouse.
There are three tactics:
1. Mouse does not know where cheese is, it moves till every piece of cheese is eaten.
2. Mouse knows the direction of closest cheese.
3. Mouse knows exactly where the cheese is.
